# IELTS Real-Time Updates Application

## 📘 Description

The **IELTS Real-Time Updates Application** is a web-based solution designed to provide instant communication between test administrators and test takers during IELTS speaking test sessions. The primary goal of this system is to allow the test administrator to send live updates, instructions, or reminders, which are immediately displayed on the test taker's dashboard using real-time WebSocket communication.

This app enhances the organization and flow of speaking tests—particularly in remote or large-scale environments—by reducing the delay between instructions and responses, improving the test experience for both parties.

Built using **React** with **TypeScript** for the frontend and **WebSocket** for the real-time message delivery, this application ensures reliable and fast communication with a user-friendly interface.
